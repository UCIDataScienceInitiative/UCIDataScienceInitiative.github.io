## Introduction

This workshop covers data visualization and performance issues in R. You will become familiar with the layered grammar of graphics behind ggplot2 and the reactive environment in Shiny through detailed hands-on examples. For the second half of the course, you will be guided through vector methods and vectorization, as well as other methods to write cleaner, quicker performance code.


**Prerequisites:** Introduction to R, or equivalent experience using R.
