## Introduction

This half-day course builds upon *Predictive Modeling with Python*, covering best practices for building predictive models that perform well in noisy, real-world domains.  Feature learning/engineering and model ensembling will be the focus of the course.  Examples and exercises will be implemented using Jupyter (formerly iPython) notebooks and the SciKit-Learn library.  Participants must have taken Predictive Modeling with Python or obtain instructor permission to enroll.

**Who:** Anyone who has completed the *Predictive Modeling with Python* course and wishes to train and deploy predicitve models in real-world domains.

**Requirements:** Participants must bring a laptop with a few specific software packages installed (see [Pre-Workshop Instructions](#Instructions)). 

**Prerequisites:** *Predictive Modeling with Python* short course

**Contact**: Please mail [enalisni@uci.edu](mailto:enalisni@uci.edu) for more information.
