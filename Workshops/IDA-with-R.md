## Description
This course provides a brief introduction to the fundamentals of the R language and focuses on its use for data analysis--including exploratory data analysis, linear and logistic regression, variable selection, model diagnostics, and prediction.


**Who:** The course is aimed at graudate students and other researchers from non-ICS schools. *You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop, bust some programming experience is necessary.*

**Requirements:** Participants must bring a laptop with both R and RStudio installed (see [Pre-Workshop Instructions](#Instructions)). 

**Prerequisites:** Some programming experience is recommended. 

**Contact**: Please email [emilyjs@uci.edu](mailto:emilyjs@uci.edu) or [galbraic@uci.edu](mailto:galbraic@uci.edu) for more information.

* **Fundamentals of R & RStudio**: the basics--including objects, subsetting, indexing, data I/O, and control structures.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis**: all the necessary tools to investigate your data before performing any formal modeling--from summary statistics to plotting histgrams, boxplots, and scatterplots
* **Linear Regression**: everything you need to know to begin fitting linear models--from simple t-tests to estimation of regression coefficients, variable selection, model diagnostics, and predection 
* **Logistic Regression**: the basics of generalized linear models (GLMs) with an emphais on binary response data--we extend the theory and modeling strategies of linear regression

### Step 1: Download and install R
First, visit The R Project for Statistical Computing's website through <https://www.r-project.org/>. Click on "CRAN" under the Download section on the left-hand side of the page. Then, click on any of the nearby websites under the USA section near the bottom of the page. For example, the link from the University of California, Berkley, CA or University of California, Los Angeles, CA are both fine. Download R for your platform (Linux, Mac, or Windows).


### Step 2: Download and install RStudio
RStudio is a set of integrated tools designed to help you be more productive with R; it is known to be more user-friendly. You will be doing essentially all of your programming in RStudio. To download RStudio, go to <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>. Download the installer for your platform under "Installers for Supported Platforms".


### Step 3: Come to the Workshop
You are now ready for the workshop! We will cover the rest of the ocurse materials together, inluding installing packages.
