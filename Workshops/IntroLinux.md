## Introduction

This course covers how to best exploit the bash shell for both interactive work and batch jobs, moving & simple manipulation of data, as well very short introductions to programming in bash, Perl, and R. This is not computer science; this is a driverâ€™s license.

**Who:** This course is for researchers who have never used Linux and/or a computer cluster and introduces concepts and best practices for both. **You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.**

**Requirements:** Participants must bring a laptop with a few specific software packages installed (see [Pre-Workshop Instructions](#Instructions)). 

**Prerequisites:** Basic programming experience. 

**Contact**: Please mail [hjmangalam@gmail.com](mailto:hjmangalam@gmail.com) for more information.
