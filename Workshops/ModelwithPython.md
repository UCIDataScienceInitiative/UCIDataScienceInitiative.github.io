## Introduction

Python is a popular language for scientific computing and machine learning. This course will introduce general modeling concepts via exercises in which participants implement regression models in raw python and via the scikit-learn library.  Focus will be given to model fitting and evaluation. The course will be taught mostly through the medium of Jupyter notebooks.

**Who:** This course is targeted primarily at graduate students and researchers who have not already taken a full course in machine learning.

**Requirements:** Participants must bring a laptop with a few specific software packages installed (see [Pre-Workshop Instructions](#Instructions)). 

**Prerequisites:** A previous course in programming is strongly recommended. 

**Contact**: Please mail [thinkle@uci.edu](mailto:thinkle@uci.edu) or [jschombe@uci.edu](mailto:jschombe@uci.edu) for more information.
