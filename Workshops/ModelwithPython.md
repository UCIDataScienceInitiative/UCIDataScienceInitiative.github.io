## Introduction

Python is a popular language for scientific processing and machine learning. This course will introduce general modeling concepts in addition to concrete examples based on the scikit-learn library. Example usage of scikit-learn will illustrate how to fit and evaluate predictive models. Regression and classification settings will be considered. The course will be taught mostly through the medium of iPython notebooks.

**Who:** This course is targeted primarily at graduate students and researchers who have not already taken a full course in machine learning.

**Requirements:** Participants must bring a laptop with a few specific software packages installed (see [Pre-Workshop Instructions](#Instructions)). 

**Prerequisites:** A previous course in programming is recommended.
