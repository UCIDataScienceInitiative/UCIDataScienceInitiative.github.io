## Introduction

This course provides an introduction to the basics of using open source software tools to analyze large scale genomics data, specifically Next Generation Sequencing data.

In this course, you will learn general NGS workflow, data analysis pipeline, data formats, short read mapping and alignment software, general workflow for DNA-seq, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. Data visualization tools will also be covered. Single Cell RNA-seq will be discussed.

**Who:** This course is designed for faculty, postdocs and graduate students who are working on genomics and other large analytical projects and want a quick introduction to Bioinformatics. It is recommended that you take the Intro to Linux workshop first. 

**Requirements:** Participants must bring a laptop with a few specific software packages installed (see [Pre-Workshop Instructions](#Instructions)). 

**Prerequisites:** Some programming experience is recommended. 

**Contact**: Please mail [jie.wu@uci.edu](mailto:jie.wu@uci.edu) for more information.
