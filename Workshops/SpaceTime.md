## Introduction

Data collected in time and/or space exhibit unique properties that require attention to draw proper conclusions from statistical analyses. In this workshop, students are introduced to statistical concepts that are particularly useful for analyzing spatial-temporal data.
**Who:** This course is targeted primarily at graduate students and researchers who have not already taken a full course in machine learning.

**Requirements:** Participants must bring a laptop with a few specific software packages installed (see [Pre-Workshop Instructions](#Instructions)). 

**Prerequisites:** Previous experience with R or Python, and a strong grasp on introductory statistics. 

**Contact**: Please mail [gregleebritten@gmail.com](mailto:gregleebritten@gmail.com) or [ymohajer@uci.edu](mailto:ymohajer@uci.edu) for more information.
