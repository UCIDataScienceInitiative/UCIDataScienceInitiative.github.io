## Introduction

Data collected in time and/or space exhibit unique properties that require attention to draw proper conclusions from statistical analyses. In this workshop, students are introduced to statistical concepts that are particularly useful for analyzing spatial-temporal data.

**Who:** This course is targeted primarily at graduate students and researchers who are interested in applied spatial-temporal data analysis

**Requirements:** Participants must bring a laptop with a few specific software packages installed (see [Pre-Workshop Instructions](#Instructions)).

**Prerequisites:** Previous experience with R or Python and knowledge of basic statistical concepts (at least one statistics course or experience statistically analyzing data).

**Contact**: Please mail [gregleebritten@gmail.com](mailto:gregleebritten@gmail.com) or [ymohajer@uci.edu](mailto:ymohajer@uci.edu) for more information.
